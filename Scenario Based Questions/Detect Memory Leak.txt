✅ What is a Memory Leak in an SPA?

1. A memory leak happens when your app keeps consuming more RAM over time and never frees it — often caused by:

2. Uncleaned event listeners

3. Unsubscribed WebSocket/SSE listeners

4. Timers (setInterval / setTimeout) not clearedf

5. React components not unmounting properly

6. Large data references hanging around in closures

7. Growing caches (Redux, SWR, React Query, custom caches)
